Add lyric into FLAC or OGG files

## Usage

1. Download and config Python Env (python3)
2. Open a terminal and type `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Just run `python main.py` and follow the guide

## Compatibility

This programme just supports FLAC or OGG files. And please put your lyric files and songs together and give them the same names.

For example, `1.flac` will get the content of `1.flac.txt` or `1.flac.lrc` or `1.txt` or `1.lrc` and add the content into the `LYRIC` tag of `1.flac`
